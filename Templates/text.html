    <h2 class="mb-3">Brain Tumor</h2>
    <p>
        A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it. Brain tumors can happen in the brain tissue. Brain tumors also can happen near the brain tissue. Nearby locations include nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain.

        Brain tumors can begin in the brain. These are called primary brain tumors. Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors.
        
        Many different types of primary brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press on the brain tissue. Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors. Brain cancers may grow quickly. The cancer cells can invade and destroy the brain tissue.
        
        Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large. Some brain tumors are found when they are very small because they cause symptoms that you notice right away. Other brain tumors grow very large before they're found. Some parts of the brain are less active than others. If a brain tumor starts in a part of the brain that's less active, it might not cause symptoms right away. The brain tumor size could become quite large before the tumor is detected.
        
        Brain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location. Common treatments include surgery and radiation therapy.    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Type</h2>
    <p>There are many types of brain tumors. The type of brain tumor is based on the kind of cells that make up the tumor. Special lab tests on the tumor cells can give information about the cells. Your health care team uses this information to figure out the type of brain tumor.

        Some types of brain tumors usually aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Some types of brain tumors usually are cancerous. These types are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. Some brain tumor types can be benign or malignant.
        
        <br>Benign brain tumors tend to be slow-growing brain tumors. Malignant brain tumors tend to be fast-growing brain tumors.
        Types of brain tumors include:

        <br>Gliomas and related brain tumors. 
        <br>Gliomas are growths of cells that look like glial cells. 
        <br>The glial cells surround and support nerve cells in the brain tissue. 
        <br>Types of gliomas and related brain tumors include astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma and ependymoma. 
        <br>Gliomas can be benign, but most are malignant. 
        <br>Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain tumor.
        <br>Choroid plexus tumors. 
        <br>Choroid plexus tumors start in cells that make the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. 
        <br>This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. 
        <br>Choroid plexus tumors are located in the fluid-filled cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. 
        <br>Choroid plexus tumors can be benign or malignant. 
        <br>Choroid plexus carcinoma is the malignant form of this type of brain tumor. 
        <br>It's more common in children.
        <br>Embryonal tumors.

                    An acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) is a benign tumor that develops on the balance and hearing nerves leading from the inner ear to the brain. These nerves are twined together to form the vestibulocochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve). The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause hearing loss and imbalance.

    <h2 class="mb-3">Symptoms</h2>
    <p>
        The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. Symptoms also might depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade.
        
        General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include:
        
        <br>- Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning.
        <br>- Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe.
        <br>- Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines.
        <br>- Nausea or vomiting.
        <br>- Eye problems, such as blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the sides of your vision.
        <br>- Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg.
        <br>- Trouble with balance.
        <br>- Speech problems.
        <br>- Feeling very tired.
        <br>- Confusion in everyday matters.
        <br>- Memory problems.
        <br>- Having trouble following simple commands.
        <br>- Personality or behavior changes.
        <br>- Seizures, especially if there is no history of seizures.
        <br>- Hearing problems.
        <br>- Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo.
        <br>- Feeling very hungry and gaining weight.


        <br>Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to cause symptoms that develop slowly. Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors. They might cause subtle symptoms that you don't notice at first. The symptoms might get worse over months or years.
        
        Cancerous brain tumors cause symptoms that get worse quickly. Cancerous brain tumors also are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. They cause symptoms that come on suddenly. They get worse in a matter of days or weeks.
        
        Brain tumor headaches
        Headaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors. Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors. Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor presses on healthy cells around it. Or a brain tumor can cause swelling in the brain that increases pressure in the head and leads to a headache.
        
        Headache pain caused by brain tumors is often worse when you wake up in the morning. But it can happen at any time. Some people have headaches that wake them from sleep. Brain tumor headaches tend to cause pain that's worse when coughing or straining. People with brain tumors most often report that the headache feels like a tension headache. Some people say the headache feels like a migraine.
        
        Brain tumors in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain. If the brain tumor happens in the front of the head, the headache might feel like eye pain or sinus pain.</p>
